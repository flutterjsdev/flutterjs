# FlutterJS Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The FlutterJS community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inspiring, and safe environment for everyone. We believe in the power of open source to bring people together, and we are committed to ensuring that all participants—regardless of experience level, background, or identity—feel respected and valued.

## 2. Our Values

To maintain a healthy community, we ask all contributors and maintainers to adhere to the following values:

*   **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is part of development, but it must remain professional. Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments will not be tolerated.
*   **Be Inclusive**: We welcome people from all walks of life. Discrimination based on age, race, gender, religion, or any other personal characteristic has no place here.
*   **Be Collaborative**: Open source thrives on collaboration. Help others, accept feedback gracefully, and give credit where it is due.
*   **Be Patient**: Not everyone has the same context or experience. Explain concepts clearly and assume good intentions.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are strictly prohibited:

*   Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
*   Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Reporting & Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately to the project maintainers at **help@flutterjs.dev**.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

**Consequences**:
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from all project spaces.

## 5. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all FlutterJS community spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, and any associated communication channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
