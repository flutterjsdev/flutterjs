Here’s a concise one-line explanation for each class in the file:

- **StatementIR** – Abstract base class for all statement intermediate representation nodes with built-in widget usage tracking.
- **ExpressionStmt** – Represents a standalone expression used as a statement (e.g., function call, assignment).
- **VariableDeclarationStmt** – Declares a variable with optional type, initializer, and mutability flags (final/const/late).
- **ReturnStmt** – Represents a `return` statement, optionally returning an expression.
- **BreakStmt** – Represents a `break` statement, optionally with a label.
- **ContinueStmt** – Represents a `continue` statement, optionally with a label.
- **ThrowStmt** – Represents a `throw` statement that throws an exception expression.
- **BlockStmt** – Groups multiple statements into a block (`{ … }`) and supports nested widget extraction.
- **IfStmt** – Represents an `if` statement with a condition, then-branch, and optional else-branch.
- **ForStmt** – Classic C-style `for` loop with initialization, condition, updaters, and body.
- **ForEachStmt** – Represents a `for-in` (or `await for`) loop over an iterable.
- **WhileStmt** – Represents a `while` loop with a condition and body.
- **DoWhileStmt** – Represents a `do-while` loop that executes the body first, then checks the condition.
- **SwitchStmt** – Represents a `switch` statement with an expression and multiple case/default branches.
- **SwitchCaseStmt** – Represents a single `case` or `default` branch inside a switch, containing statements.
- **TryStmt** – Represents a `try-catch-finally` block with try body, catch clauses, and optional finally.
- **CatchClauseStmt** – Represents a single `catch` clause with exception type, parameters, and body.
- **AssertStatementIR** – Represents an `assert(condition, message?)` statement.
- **EmptyStatementIR** – Represents a standalone semicolon (`;`) with no effect.
- **YieldStatementIR** – Represents a `yield` or `yield*` statement in generators/async* functions.
- **LabeledStatementIR** – Attaches a label to another statement for use with `break`/`continue`.
- **FunctionDeclarationStatementIR** – Represents a local function declaration appearing as a statement.
- **WidgetUsageIR** – Captures detailed information about a single Flutter widget instantiation (name, properties, context, etc.).
- **StatementBodyWidgetAnalysis (extension)** – Adds `getAllWidgetUsages()` to lists of statements for recursive widget collection across blocks, branches, and loops.
